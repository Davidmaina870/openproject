## Learn more about OpenProject

### Is OpenProject free of charge?

We offer three different versions of OpenProject. Please get an overview of the different OpenProject Editions [here](https://www.openproject.org/pricing/). The (on-premise) OpenProject Community edition is completely free. The Enterprise cloud and Enterprise on-premises edition offer premium features and support and thus we are charging for it. Nevertheless, we offer free 14 days trials for the Enterprise versions so that you can get to know their benefits. If you prefer to use the free OpenProject Community edition, you can follow these [installation instructions](https://www.openproject.org/download-and-installation/), please note that you need a Linux server to install the Community edition. It is always possible to upgrade from the Community to the Enterprise cloud and Enterprise on-premises edition – check out the premium features [here](https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/#premium-features).

### How do I get access to the OpenProject premium features?
We offer the premium functions of OpenProject (incl. boards) for two different OpenProject variants:

* For the OpenProject Enterprise cloud edition (hosted by us),
* For the self-hosted (on-premises) OpenProject Enterprise on-premises edition

If you want to run OpenProject on your own server the OpenProject Enterprise on-premises edition is the right option.
Have you already installed the [OpenProject Community edition](https://www.openproject.org/download-and-installation/)? If yes, you can request a trial license for the OpenProject Enterprise on-premises edition by clicking on the button "Free trial license" [here](https://www.openproject.org/de/enterprise-edition/) and test the Enterprise on-premises edition for 14 days for free.

### What are the system requirements?

The system requirements can be found [here](../installation-and-operations/system-requirements).

Apart from using OpenProject in the cloud (OpenProject Enterprise cloud) OpenProject can be installed in two different ways: The packaged installation of OpenProject is the recommended way to install and maintain OpenProject using DEB or RPM packages. There's also a Docker based installation option.

### Can I run OpenProject as a single user?

Our minimum plan for the Enterprise cloud edition and Enterprise on-premises edition is five users. Our pricing scheme covers three subscription options: Community Edition ($0), Enterprise cloud (€4.95/member/month or approximately $5.60/member/month), and Enterprise on-premises (€5.95/member/month or approximately $6.73/member/month). We recommend to start the [Community version](https://www.openproject.org/download-and-installation/) free of charge if the five user minimum is an issue for you.

### How can I change the day my week starts with, etc.?

You can do this as a system administrator in the [System settings](../system-admin-guide/system-settings/display-settings/#time-and-date-formatting).

## FAQ regarding features

### Is it possible to use multiple languages in OpenProject?

Yes, it is possible to use OpenProject in multiple languages. We support English, German, French and a number of additional languages. Each user can select their own preferred language by signing into OpenProject, clicking on the user avatar on the upper right side and selecting "My account" from the dropdown menu.
You can then select "Settings" from the side menu on the left side and [change the language](../my-account/#change-your-language).

### Is there an OpenProject app?

There is no native iOS or Android app for OpenProject, but OpenProject is responsive - so it displays well on smaller screens.

### Is it possible to connect MS Project and OpenProject or to migrate from MS Project to OpenProject?

Yes, please use the free [Excel synchronization](../user-guide/integrations/excel synchronization) for this.

### Do you have OpenProject guest accounts?

Currently, all users working in the OpenProject Enterprise editions need a license in order to access OpenProject. Regarding payments we only count the active (not blocked) users.

### Can I have both users with the Enterprise cloud and others with the Enterprise on-premises Edition?

This is only possible if you book two different plans for OpenProject. The users won't be able to work together directly. We strongly recommend using either Enterprise cloud *or* Enterprise on-premises, if you want to collaborate with all colleagues.

### Can I get a notification when a deadline approaches?

Not at the moment. This is a well-known feature requirement and we are currently working on the specification for this with our dev team. It's already on our roadmap and it will be developed in one of the upcoming releases. 

### Does OpenProject offer resource management?

You can [set up budgets](../user-guide/budgets), [set an Estimated time](../user-guide/work-packages/edit-work-package/) for a work package and use the [Assignee board](../user-guide/agile-boards/#choose-between-board-types) to find out how many work packages are assigned to a person, yet. 
Additional resource management features will be added within the next years. You can find the roadmap for future releases [here](https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages?query_id=1993).

### Is there an organizational chart in OpenProject?

There's no such feature. However, you can use the wiki to add information regarding your departments and employees. Furthermore, you can upload existing org charts as image or e.g. PDF to the wiki or the documents module. 

In many companies it makes sense to structure your project tree according to your departments (i.e. one parent project for each department with projects for each topic or client underneath).

### Can I set up an entity-relationship diagram in OpenProject?

No, currently we do not have an entity-relationship diagram for OpenProject.

## FAQ regarding OpenProject BIM edition

Please have a look at our [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThA4_17yedg) and at our [website](https://www.openproject.org/bim-project-management/). You can start a free trial there, too.

### Which IFC format are you using for conversion in the BIM module?

IFC2x3 and IFC4. We accept those formats and convert them to some other format that is optimized for web.

### Is there a way to use OpenProject BIM for free, too?

Yes, (only) as part of the Community Edition you can use OpenProject BIM for free. Please have a look [here](../installation-and-operations/changing-to-bim-edition/) to find out how to activate the BIM modules in your on-premises installation.
