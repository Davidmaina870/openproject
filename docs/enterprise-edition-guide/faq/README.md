Simply click on "Get free trial license" to receive a 14 day trial license. After 14 days it will automatically downgraded to the community edition.

## How can I book additional users?

Please use the link "Manage subscription" in the email you received confirming your subscription or contact sales@openproject.com. 

## Is it possible to only upgrade *some* users to the Enterprise Edition?

This is not possible, as the Premium features affect the whole OpenProject instance and not the individual users.

## I didn't receive my license key / my Enterprise token

The Enterprise token is sent to the email address used to create the subscription. If you can't find it in the spam folder and if you already paid for the subscription please contact support.

## Can I use my own domain name?

Yes, for Enterprise on-premises and for Community Edition you will have to choose your own domain name during [initial configuration](../../installation-and-operations/installation/packaged/#initial-configuration) after installing OpenProject.

## How can I downgrade from Enterprise Edition to Community Edition?

You don't have to do anything. Just don't renew your subscription. As soon as your subscription or your trial ends you will automatically be downgraded to the Community Edition. You can keep your data.
