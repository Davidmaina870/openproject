# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for Time and costs

## Is there a way to prevent logging hours for Phases (or other work package types)? 

It is not possible to prevent time logging on phases or restrict it to certain work package types. You could deactivate the fields "Estimated time" and "Spent time" for type Phase (using the [work package form configuration](../../../system-admin-guide/manage-work-packages/work-package-types/#work-package-form-configuration)) but it would still be possible to log time for Phases.

## Can I log time for another user than myself?

Currently, that's not possible. 
Possible workarounds: Log in as the other user or set up a cost type (e.g."developer hours" or "John Smith") for unit costs and use this to log time (as unit cost) for others.
