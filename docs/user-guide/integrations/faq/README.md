# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for integrations

## Is there an integration with Outlook?

No, we don't have an outlook integration. Nevertheless, you can define incoming emails to OpenProject to get converted into tasks. Also, you can configure the email notifications sent by OpenProject to the project members. More information can be found [here](../../system-admin-guide/email/#email-settings).

## Is there an integration with OneNote?

No, there isn't.

## Is there a Slack integration?

Yes, there's a Slack plugin. Please note that the Slack plugin is not officially supported by OpenProject. For Enterprise on-premises please find the OpenProject Slack Plugin and its documentation [here](https://github.com/opf/openproject-slack#openproject-slack-plugin). You can also look at [Slack's respective website](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for information.

For Enterprise cloud please contact support to have it activated in your instance.
