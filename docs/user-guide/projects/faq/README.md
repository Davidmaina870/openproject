# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for projects

### How can I get an overview over multiple projects at the same time?

There are several possibilities:

1. To see only the projects without their work packages go to the [Projects overview](../#view-all-projects) ("View all projects")
2. To see all work packages go to the work package module and set the filter "Subproject". Alternatively you can click on *Modules ->Work packages* in the upper right hand corner to access the [global work packages list](../#global-work-packages-list).
3. Go to the Project overview of a project with subprojects, add the widget "Work package table" and set the filter mentioned above. Find more information on this topic [here](../../project-overview/#add-a-widget-to-the-project-overview). Additionally you could add the column "Progress".
4. Add the widget "Work package table" to your My Page and set the filter mentioned above. Find more information on this topic [here](../../../getting-started/my-page/#configure-the-my-page). Additionally you could add the column "Progress".

We will introduce further similar functions in the course of implementing multi-project management, this is planned for the next few years. 

### We have different departments in our company and need projects by departments. Can I use sub-projects for the departments?

Yes, that is in most cases the best solution.
