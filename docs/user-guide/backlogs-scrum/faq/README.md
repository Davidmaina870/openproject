# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for Backlogs

## How can I change the user's colors in the task board?

The colors can be changed in each user's personal settings: Please click on your avatar, then navigate to *My account ->Settings ->Backlogs*. There you can change the task color.

## What can I do to show the tasks of shared sub-projects in the backlog?

This is not possible. "Work packages from sub-projects are not displayed in the backlog of a main project" is the currently implemented behavior. 

## I assigned a version to work packages. Why can't I see them in the respective backlog?

Please make sure that
A) The respective version is assigned to a column in the backlog (see *Project settings ->Versions*).
B) The work packages you want to display in the backlog are of a type that gets displayed in the backlog. If not: Either change the work package type or change the backlog setting (see *Administration ->Backlogs*).
