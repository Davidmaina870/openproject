# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for Gantt chart

## Is there a critical path feature?

Unfortunately, we don't have the critical path feature yet. We have a feature request for it though and will check how to integrate it into our road map. A workaround could be to [create predecessor-successor relations](../../work-packages/work-package-relations-hierarchies/#work-package-relations) for only the work packages that are in the critical path. 

## When I am working in the Gantt chart, every change seems to take quite long. 

We understand that the loading time when working in Gantt Chart is too long for you. The reason for this is that every single action is saved. So everything is fine with your installation. We have already taken up the point with us and already have first ideas for a technical solution. The respective feature request can be found [here](https://community.openproject.com/projects/openproject/work_packages/34176/activity).
